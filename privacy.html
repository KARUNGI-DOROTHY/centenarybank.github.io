               <h2>PRIVACY POLICY.</h2>
               <h3>Why we collect and process personal data</h3>
               <p>For the purpose of establishment, continuation and management of banking relationships and in order for the Bank to fulfil the contract with a customer for a product or service requested, we need to collect and process that customer’s personal data. This includes the following:</p>
               <ol>
                <li>processing applications for products and services</li>
                <li>effecting transactions </li>
                <li>completing instructions or requests</li>
                <li>providing products and services</li>
                <li>assessing suitability for a product or service</li>
                <li>credit assessments</li>
                <li>statistical purposes</li>
                <li>surveillance of bank premises including ATMs for security purposes</li>
               </ol>
                <p>We may also process your personal data where it is in our legitimate interests to seek professional advice. For example, to defend our rights in connection with any legal proceedings.</p>
                <h3>Disclosure of personal data</h3>
                <p>KCB Bank may disclose your personal data to any of the following parties in connection with any of the purposes outlined above:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Any director, officer or employee of the bank</li>
                    <li>professional advisers such as auditors, third party service providers, agents or independent contractors providing services to support the bank’s business</li>
                    <li>any person to whom disclosure is permitted or required by law</li>
                    <li>any court, regulatory body, law enforcement agency where required by law</li>

                    <li>any financial institution conducting credit, fraud and anti-money laundering checks for prevention of financial crime</li>
                </ol>
                <h3>Personal data outside Uganda</h3>
                <p>The bank will not process or store personal data outside Uganda without the express consent of the data owner. Where such consent is obtained, the bank shall ensure the country where the data is to be processed or stored has adequate laws in place for the protection of such data equivalent or greater than Uganda.</p>
                <h3>Security of personal data</h3>
                <p>The security of personal data is of paramount importance. The bank has put in place robust technical and administrative information security measures to safeguard your personal data. We also ensure that third party service providers adhere to security standards mandated by the bank. Regardless of where personal data is transferred, we take all steps reasonably necessary to ensure that personal data is kept securely.</p>
                <p>While we strive for the highest standards of security, you should be aware that the internet is not a secure form of communication. Thus, sending us any personal data over the internet carries with it risks including the risk of access and interference by unauthorized third parties. Information sent through the internet may be transmitted internationally (even when sender and recipient are located in the same country) via countries with weaker privacy and data protection laws than Uganda.</p>
                <h3>Retention of personal data</h3>
                <p>The bank only retains your personal data in line with our legal and regulatory obligations and for business and operational purposes. This means we keep personal data for at least 10 years from when a transaction was conducted. In the case of  account holders, we keep personal data for at least 10 years from when the account is closed.</p>
                <h3>Changes to this Data Privacy Statement</h3>
                <p>This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time and you are advised to visit our website regularly to check for any amendments. This policy was last updated on 10/3/2022.</p>
